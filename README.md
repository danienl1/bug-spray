 # Project Overview

This project is a POC to for bug bounty. It aims to enhance productivity and automate repetitive tasks associated with penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.

## Current Functionality (so far)

### Technology Stack Analysis
- The platform includes a component that uses OpenAI's language model to analyze the HTML content of a website and predict the technology stack being used. This includes identifying the CMS, frameworks, analytics tools, and other technologies.


### HTML Preprocessing
- Extracts relevant parts of the HTML, such as meta tags, script sources, and link references, to prepare the data for analysis.

### Display of Predicted Stack
- After analysis, the platform displays the predicted technology stack, providing insights into the technologies used by the target website.


## To do
- **Automated Reconnaissance**: Implement tools for automated reconnaissance, including subdomain enumeration, DNS record gathering, and IP address collection.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate in-app tools for quick vulnerability scans, such as XSS and SQL injection detection.
